# Call Notification Service for Azure Communication Services Call Automation

This library contains the deployable service and a client to interact with the Call Notification Service which can dispatch inbound call notifications from the Azure Communication Services Call Automation platform. The Call Automation platform sends inbound call notifications in the form of an `IncomingCall` schema to an Event Grid subscription; often taking the form of an HTTP/S Webhook callback subscription type.

## Rapid development use cases

- No need to maintain the Event Grid subscription when your development endpoint changes
